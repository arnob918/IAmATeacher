# Combinatorics Notes


### 1. addition / multiplication principle

* If we have $A$ number of ways of doing something and $B$ number of ways of doing another thing and we cannot do both at the same time, then there are $A+B$ ways to choose one of the actions.
* if there are $A$ ways of doing something and $B$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $A \times B$ ways of performing both actions.
* Addition when you can not do both and Multiplication when you have to do both, normally, one after another.

problems:
1. There are $X$ ways to go from point $A$ to $B$ and $Y$ ways from point $B$ to $C$. Then there are total $X \times Y$ ways to go from $A$ to $C$.
